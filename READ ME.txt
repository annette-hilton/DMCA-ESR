%This folder contins the Matlab functions to run the event identification given rainfall 
and streamflow (or eventually runoff) time series.

%How to use it:
The file "example.m" contains an example of how to run all the functions taking the data
from "daily_rainfall_27071.txt" and "daily_flow_27071.txt". 

%Brief explenation of the files:
"EVENT_IDENTIFICATION_DMCA.m" contains the routine to identify the events. It calls all the "STEP_xx_....m"
functions, which corresponds to the Steps in Section 2.1.

"EVENT_ANALYSIS.m" computes the event properties.

"BASEFLOW_CURVE.m" produces the baseflow connecting the delimiters of the stremflow events.
This function is also called by "EVENT_ANALYSIS.m".
